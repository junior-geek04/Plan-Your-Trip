						<p>We, at ASKMETRIP believes in the unique fusion of globetrotting with a fun filled learning experience. We dare to elevate the basic essence of learning inside of a bubble and give you a chance to learn outside with nature itself. We believe, learning should not be limited to the classrooms, rather it should also develop an understanding of art, literature, cultural tradition and natural resources.

We organise visit to different geographies where students can interact with different kind of natural species. This increase their knowledge base. Also, we organise group activities and teach the importance of team dynamics. This gives students a broad learning opportunity along with fun activity. We engage our students to visit a place and learn about it. </p>
						<p><b>2. Curriculum Trips :</b> Many students understand the subject when they experience it in practical manner. So, we arrange trips to Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) centres, Museum and other such places where a vast learning scope is there. These types of subject trips would be organised according to school’s requirement.</p>
